The diff summary does not show actual addition/movement of the required image assets into `frontend/public/assets/generated/`, nor does it show any concrete update to `frontend/src/components/CategoryGrid.tsx` image `src` references; those are only mentioned inside `frontend-file-summaries.txt` without corresponding file diffs.",
