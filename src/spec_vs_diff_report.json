  "summary": "Diff adds a CraftyMini single-page React landing layout with hero, collection grid, why-choose section, order form logic (mailto generation + validation), contact section, and a warm craft-themed Tailwind/CSS setup. It also introduces unused Internet Identity/auth + actor hooks and an empty backend canister. Some acceptance criteria cannot be verified due to truncation and missing evidence for static image assets.",

      "reason": "Order form code sets a `showMessage` state after attempting `window.location.href = mailtoLink`, but the diff excerpt does not include any rendered fallback UI that shows the email address and generated body for copy/paste (only a clipboard-copy function is shown).",
